# HQ CB List Mailer for Community Builder

## Description
My issue was that I needed to create bulk email messages to Users in my Joomla CB database on a filtered basis. I.e. Users that yet had not completed a certain training, Users that were of a certain age, etc. In my emails I needed to include fields from the CB database such as firstname, lastname, etc. Additionally I needed the email to be sent to multiple addresses for each user (not possible with other solutions such as ACY-mailing).

Solution created: Joomla Component HQCBListMailer

With some help from http://www.component-creator.com/ I created a Joomla Component that took advantage from CB list functionality for creation of filters for the emails and added an email template functionality for writing the email and adding CB fields to them. 

I created a sender that would preview emails, send one of them to a specified address for email client preview and then a final button for sending the emails to all receivers.

The component is made for Joomla 2.5 and 3.x. CB version is 2.x.
